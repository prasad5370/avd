5. Accept a character from the keyboard. Write a program to check if a given character is a vowel or consonant.
Note: Vowels are a,e,i,o,u.

word = input('enter a word: ')

if word[0] in ['a','e','i','o','u']: print(word[0],'is Vowel')
else: print(word[0],'is consonant')



6. Write a program to check if a given number is prime or not.
Note: Prime number is a number that is not divisible by any other number except by 2 and itself.

num = int(input('enter a number: '))

for i in range(2,num):
    if num%i == 0:
        print(num,'is not prime number')
        break
else: print(num,'is prime number')

7. Write a program to generate prime number series.
Note: you have to display n primes as: 2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19, etc.

num = int(input('enter a number: '))

for i in range(2,num+1):
    for j in range(2, num+1):
        if i%j == 0:
            break
    if i == j:
        print(i)

8. 1. Write a Python program to reverse a list of numbers given.
Ex: the given list is [10, 20, 5, 4, 33, 22]
Your program should print [22, 33, 4, 5, 20, 10]
Note: Do the above program without using slicing and reverse() methods. 


lst = [10, 20, 5, 4, 33, 22]

revLst = []
for i in range(len(lst)-1,-1,-1):
    revLst.append(lst[i])

print(revLst)
